## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python**: The core programming language.
* **Gradio**: For creating the interactive web application interface.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
* **NumPy**: For numerical operations, especially during data preprocessing.
* **Plotly Express**: For generating interactive and aesthetically pleasing data visualizations.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `netflix_titles.csv`, which contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix as of a certain date.

You can download the original dataset from Kaggle:
[Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)

**Please ensure the `netflix_titles.csv` file is placed in the root directory of this project alongside `app.py` for the application to run correctly.**

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/netflix-gradio-eda.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/netflix-gradio-eda.git)
    cd netflix-gradio-eda
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
4.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Run the Gradio application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    This will start the Gradio server, and you'll typically see a local URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:7860`) in your terminal. Open this URL in your web browser.

Once deployed, your app will be accessible at:
**[YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_SPACES_LINK]**
(e.g., `https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/netflix-eda-dashboard`)

## üí° Future Enhancements

* **Advanced Filtering:** Implement more complex filtering options, such as filtering by director, cast, or description keywords.
* **Statistical Summaries:** Add sections for deeper statistical insights (e.g., mean/median duration by genre, average ratings by country).
* **Comparison Tools:** Allow users to compare distributions or trends between selected categories (e.g., compare movie durations across different ratings).
* **User Feedback:** Implement a simple feedback mechanism within the Gradio app.
* **Download Filtered Data:** Provide an option to download the currently filtered dataset.
